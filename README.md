# Building-Blocks
Use different blocks to build something

This application will allow you to use different shapes to make something you want to. It uses Jquery's drag and drop system. You can fiddle around with the shapes but also change the sizes of the shapes you put on your screen as per your desire.

For further convenience the application also includes options to undo action and completely clear your screen. Children of small ages specically fiddling around with such.

I am always open to suggestions, you can tell me by dropping a mail, at the provided address. Please Include the project name in your email.

Thank-You
